**fix_tvar_top**  
  Logical flag indicating whether thermal variable (T,S) should be fixed on the upper boundary.  Default = .true.
**fix_tvar_bottom**
  Logical flag indicating whether thermal variable (T,S) should be fixed on the lower boundary.  Default = .true.
**fix_dtdr_top**  
  Logical flag indicating whether the radial derivative of thermal variable (T,S) should be fixed on the upper boundary.  Default = .false.
**fix_dtdr_bottom**  
  Logical flag indicating whether the radial derivative of thermal variable (T,S) should be fixed on the lower boundary.  Default = .false.
**T_top**
  Value of thermal variable (T,S) at the upper boundary.  Default = 0.
**T_bottom**
  Value of thermal variable (T,S) at the lower boundary.  Default = 1.  
**dTdr_top**
  Value of radial derivative of thermal variable (T,S) at the upper boundary.  Default = 0.
**dTdr_bottom**
  Value of radial derivative of thermal variable (T,S) at the lower boundary.  Default = 0.  
**adjust_dTdr_top**
  Logical flag indicating that dTdr_top should be set based on the values of heating_integral (or luminosity) and the value of dTdr_bottom.  Default value is .false.  When .true., this flag only has an effect when fix_dtdr_top = .true. and heating_type > 0.  When active, dTdr_top is set such that the integrated flux passing through the upper boundary is equal to the sum of those due to internal heating and any flux passing through the lower boundary due to fixed dTdr_bottom.
